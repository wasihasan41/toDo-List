# Todo Web App Using JavaScript 

## Overview

This is a simple Todo List website application that allows users to add and remove tasks. It has an input text field for entering tasks and a button to add them to a list. Each task displayed on the page has an option to remove it.

## Key Features

- **Add Tasks:**
  - Type a task into the input field and click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
  
- **Remove Tasks:**
  - Each task in the list will have a "Remove" button to delete the task from the list.
  
- **Dynamic Task List:**
  - The tasks are displayed dynamically as you add them, and the list updates in real time.

## How It Works

1. **Input Task:**  
     The user inputs the task into the input box.

2. **Add Task:**  
     click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.

3. **Remove Tasks:**   
     click the "Remove" button to delete the task from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains the structure for the Todo List app. It includes:
   - An input field where users can type their tasks.
   - A button to add the task to the list.
   - A section to display the list of tasks.

- **CSS:** This file contains the styles for the Todo List app. It defines the layout, colors, and spacing.
